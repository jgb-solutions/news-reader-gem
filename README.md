# NewsReader

News Reader is a CLI app that allows you to list and read a list of articles scraped from a website on the internet. It's also available as a ruby gem.

This project is for education purpose only. Do not use it in production. I built it as a homework of the Full Stack Web Developer curriculum I'm following at Flatiron School.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'news_reader'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install news_reader

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
